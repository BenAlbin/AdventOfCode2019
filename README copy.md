Using the excellent Elixir Starter template for Advent of Code from https://github.com/mhanberg/advent-of-code-elixir-starter

# Usage
Solutions are run by using mix tasks. For example, the day 1 part 2 solution can be found by running `mix d01.p2` on the command line.

## Note
There might be some issues with line endings here, because I'm writing this on Windows. For example in the mix tasks I'm splitting the input file on the pattern "\r\n" which is the Windows line ending (instead of the usual "\n" for Unix). Will try and sort this out to just use "\n" everywhere.
